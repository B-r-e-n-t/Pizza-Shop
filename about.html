        <h1>Our food is a labor of Love</h1>
        <h4>At Neighbors Pizza, quality is everything. In a world where drive-thru’s are the norm and food 
            is often over-processed, prepackaged and always frozen, Neighbors sets itself apart by doing things 
            the old fashioned way. It’s a labor of love.</h4>
        <h3>Our ingredients are locally sourced and always fresh!</h3>
