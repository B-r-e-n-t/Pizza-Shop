  <p class="intro-paragraph-2">At Neighbors, quality is everything. In a world where a drive-thru is the 
    norm and food is often over-processed, prepackaged and always frozen, Neighbors sets itself apart by 
    doing things the old fashioned way. We use the same sourdough start for all of our pizzas. We offer neapolitan 
    style and Detroit style sourdough pizza with a variety of fresh toppings.</p>
